;; 1. Assume that we want to develop an inventory database for an
;; online CD store.  
;;
;; For each CD, the database stores its title, artist, price, how many
;; copies are in stock, and its category of music (such as rock,
;; blues, or country).  
;;
;; Write a data definition for CD inventories. When completing the
;; following exercises, please make sure to use map, filter, and
;; accumulate (aka, reduce) as much as reasonable.  
;; 
;; 1a. Create a constructor procedure with parameters, title, artist,
;; price, category, and units-in-stock, and corresponding accessors to
;; retrieve these fields.  
;; 
;; 1b. Populate an inventory (i.e., a list) with 10 or so records
;; created from your constructor.  
;;
;; 1c. Write a procedure all-titles that consumes an inventory and
;; produces a list of all titles in the inventory.  
;; 
;; 1d. Write a procedure titles-in-stock that consumes an inventory
;; and produces a list of all titles in the inventory with at least 1
;; copy in stock.  
;;
;; 1e. Write a procedure restock that consumes a CD title, number of
;; new copies of that CD and an inventory and produces an inventory in
;; which the named CD has the given number of additional copies (and
;; all other CDs remain the same).  
;; 
;; 1f. Write a procedure titles-by that consumes an artist name and
;; inventory and produces a list of titles of CDs by that artist.
;; 
;; 1g. Write a procedure copies-in-stock that consumes a CD title,
;; artist name and an inventory and produces the number of copies of
;; that item that are in stock.  Return 0 if the named CD isn't in the
;; inventory.
;; 
;; 1h. Write a procedure blues-sale that consumes an
;; inventory and produces an inventory in which all blues CDs are
;; discounted by 10%.
;; 
;; 1i. Write a procedure carry-cd? that consumes a
;; title and artist name and produces a boolean indicating whether
;; that item is in the inventory (whether in or out of stock).
;;
;; This problem is courtesy of a lab exercise from WPI's Scheme
;; course.

; Answer:
;;;;;;;;;;1a.
;Constructors
; model the db as a list of records.

;Each record is a list of (title artist price category units-in-stock)
(define (make-record title artist price category units-in-stock)

; cdDB to a new list with the new record appended.
; don't change this code
(define (insert-record rec)
  (set! cdDB (append cdDB (list rec))))

; Selectors
; these should retrieve the appropriate item from the record-list.
; remember these are procedures.

;but you should put your own here!!

;; 2. Consider the following procedure for operating on trees:
(define (tree-manip tree init leaf accum) 
  (cond ((null? tree) init) 
        ((not (pair? tree)) (leaf tree)) 
        (else (accum  
               (tree-manip (car tree) init leaf accum) 
               (tree-manip (cdr tree) init leaf accum)))))

;; Suppose that we provide a test tree, 
(define test-tree '(1 (2 (3 (4) 5) 6) 7))
;;
;; 2a. Write the parameters to tree-manip that will count the number
;;     of leaves in the tree, evaluating to 7 for test-tree; e.g.:
;;     (tree-manip test-tree <param1> <param2> <param3>). (Figure out
;;     the three parameters.)
;;
;; 2b. Write the parameters to tree-manip that will add the values of
;;     the leaves in the tree, evaluating to 28 for test-tree.
;;
;; 2c. Write the parameters to tree-manip that will triple each of the
;;     values in test-tree, evaluating to (3 (6 (9 (12) 15) 18) 21).

;; Answer:
;2a.
(define (count-leaves tree) 
  1)

;2b.
(define (sum-leaves tree) 
  1)

;2c.
(define (triple-leaves tree)

;; 4. Using flip, negate, and compose.
;;
;;     4a. Define and play with the functions flip, negate, and
;;     compose, as they are defined below.
;;
;;     4b. Define, for instance, a flipped cons function and a flipped
;;     minus function.
;;
;;     4c. Define the function odd? in terms of even? and negate.

(define (flip f)
  (lambda (x y)
    (f y x)))

(define (negate p)
  (lambda (x) 
    (if (p x) #f #t)))

(define (compose f g)

;; 5. SICP exercise 2.38 (pp. 121), introducing fold-right and fold-left.
;;
;; Write the defintion for fold-right (hint: Answer to fold-right is
;; in the question. Read the question carefully)
;;
;; Write down each step of substitution in comment line for each of
;; the following.
;;
;; What are the values of
;(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))
;(fold-left / 1 (list 1 2 3))
;(fold-right list nil (list 1 2 3))
;(fold-left list nil (list 1 2 3))

;;Answer:
;; Given in the question that accumulate is also known as fold-right. So,
(define (fold-right op initial sequence) 
  1)

;(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))
;write substitution steps

;(fold-left / 1 (list 1 2 3))
;write substitution steps

;(fold-right list nil (list 1 2 3))
;write substitution steps

;(fold-left list nil (list 1 2 3))
;write substitution steps

;op property:
;--------------
;write the property (with example if possible)

;After answering the above replace #f to #t
(define p4 #f)


;; **********************************************************************
;;
;; 6. Use fold-right to define the function bucket. 
;;
;; It consumes a list of numbers, and returns a list of sublists of
;; adjacent equal numbers.
;;
;; For example:
;; (bucket '(1 1 2 2 2 3 1 1 1 2 3 3)) â€“> 
;;  '((1 1) (2 2 2) (3) (1 1 1) (2) (3 3))
;;
;; PLEASE NOTE
;; it's trivial to find the answer for this on the internet
;; please do not succumb
;; you won't learn very much unless you struggle with it
;;
;; think about each of the two objects that are consumed by the 
;; folding function as the fold proceeds
;;
;; and think about what sort of object should be produced by that
;; function 
;; 
;; Fill in the below procedure
(define (bucket lst)
  lst);
