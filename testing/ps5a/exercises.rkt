;;1. Exercise 2.36 on pp. 120, accumulating with lists of lists.
;; fill in code where it's got <??> in two places. Page 163.
;;
;; e.g.,
;; (accumulate-n + 0 '((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9)))
;; 
;; should be
;; (12 15 18)
;;
;; (define (accumulate-n op init seqs)
;;   (if (null? (car seqs))
;;       nil
;;       (cons (accumulate op init <??>  )
;;             (accumulate-n op init <??> ))))
;; seqs is a list of lists, so every element is itself a sublist. This means we can take
;; the car of the sublists using map to extract the correct list of values to add together with accumulate.
;; So for example, the first accumulate call would return the following:
;; '(1 4 7) <-- this is the result from (map car seqs) and is summed up
;; Then the last accumulate call in this procedure would return the following:
;; '((2 3) (5 6) (8 9)) <-- Notice how we're in the second elements of each sublist now
;; Call car again in the next recursive call, you get '(2 5 8) to add up and so forth.

;;2. Exercise 2.53 on pp. 144, testing quote, pair?, and memq. Page 195.
;; Write the answers and explanation in comment line and change #f to #t

;(list 'a 'b 'c)
; '(a b c)
; Using a single quote just means to treat the following characters as
; a literal interpretation, not a symbol -- so there isn't a lookup.
; So we're making a list of literals.
(define p2_1 #t)

;(list (list 'george))
; '((george))
; The inner list call will result in a sublist, and the single quote before
; george means to interpret it literally. So this list containing the single
; literal 'george will be inside the outer list.
(define p2_2 #t)

;(cdr '((x1 x2) (y1 y2)))
; '((y1 y2))
; Each element in this list is a sublist of two elements. The car of the outer
; list is the first sublist, and the cdr is pointing to the second sublist.
(define p2_3 #t)

;(cadr '((x1 x2) (y1 y2)))
; '(y1 y2)
; cadr means the car of the cdr, so here cdr is going to the rest of the
; list which in this case is only '((y1 y2)). This sublist contains the
; sublist (y1 y2) and the empty list, and the car will get you the first
; element which is the sublist (y1 y2).
(define p2_4 #t)

;(pair? (car '(a short list)))
; #f
; '(a short list) creates a list with the literals 'a, 'short, and 'list.
; So this means the list has three elements, and taking the car only gets
; the first literal 'a which is not a pair so therefore false.
(define p2_5 #t)

;(memq 'red '((red shoes) (blue socks)))
; #f
; memq here checks if the literal symbol 'red is contained in the list.
; 'red is not eq? to any item in the list. Keep in mind that in (red shoes)
; this is embedded in a sublist and eq? will be comparing 'red with (red shoes)
; which is not the same object.
(define p2_6 #t)

;(memq 'red '(red shoes blue socks))
; '(red shoes blue socks)
; memq returns the sublist of the list beginning with the first occurrence
; of the symbol 'red. Here since we have a flat list with 'red, memq finds
; the literal 'red and is able to compare 'red with 'red which is the same object.
; Previously above, memq was doing 'red with (red shoes) and although (car '(red shoes))
; does give you 'red, the 'red was embedded in a sublist previously and to eq? that is a
; different object.
(define p2_7 #t)

;;3. Exercise 2.54 on pp. 145, building your own version of equal?. Page 196.
; Doing several checks here:
; 1.) If handed two empty lists, return true.
; 2.) If list1 and list2 are pairs, if the car of both lists satisfy equal?, if
;     the cdr of both lists satisfy equal? then return true. Otherwise, false.
; 3.) If list1 and list2 are eq? (the same object), return true.
; 4.) Otherwise, return false.

(define (my-equal? list1 list2) 
   (cond ((and (null? list1) (null? list2)) #t)
         ((and (pair? list1) (pair? list2)) ; do we have pairs here?
          (and (equal? (car list1) (car list2))) ; are car of both lists equal?
          (if (equal? (cdr list1) (cdr list2)) #t #f)) ; are cdr of both lists equal?
         ((eq? list1 list2) #t) ; if not a pair, is it same symbol?
         (else #f)) ; end cond
) ;; end define

;;4. Exercise 2.55 on pp. 145, pushing the limits of quote. Page 196.
;
; Eva Lu Ator types to the interpreter the expression
;
; (car ''abracadabra)
; 
; To her surprise, the interpreter prints back quote. Explain.
; 
; Write the answer and explanation for the below procedure call and replace
; #f with #t.
;
; > (car ''abracadabra)
; 'quote
; > (car (cdr ''abracadabra))
; 'abracadabra
; > (cdr (cdr ''abracadabra))
; '()
; ''abracadabra here is interpreted as '(quote abracadabra). This means we
; have actually generated a list of two elements; the second ' is interpreted
; literally as the symbol 'quote.
(define p4 #t)
